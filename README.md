## Description of our App
To apply for a leave, faculty and staff members have to go through a lot of paperwork. Our task is to design the Leave Management Portal that will digitalize the leave management system at IIT Ropar. 
The faculties and staff members can fill the leave application form online and view/download the leaves they have applied. The HoDs and Dean can view the respective leave applications and can Approve/Disapprove them or add any comment.
